It gives the user complete flexibility when it comes to adding/removing attributes and linking concepts. 

Its focus is simplicity and speed. Except for bootstrap it uses no frameworks whatsoever. It serves as a proof that Entity Attribute Value models aren't required even if the user wants to dynamically add attributes to the model.
